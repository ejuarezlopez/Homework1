    <p> I am using Visual Studio Code as my text editor to complete this assignment </p>
        <br>
    <p> Chapter 1 includes information of the main elements needed to create a website using HTML as the coding language for this purpose
        <br>
    </p> I learned about setting up a style that can be recalled later during the code, instead of assigning styles to each paragraph individually for example </p>
        <br>
    <p> I learned how to add a link using the anchor tag &lt;a&gt; &lt;/a&gt; </p>
